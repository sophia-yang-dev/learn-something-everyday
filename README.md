# learn-something-everyday

Welcome to my **Learn Something Every Day**!  
This is a personal project where I commit to learning something new every day (or almost every day) about programming, tech tools, and software development.

The goal is simple:
- **Learn** something small every day.
- **Record** it in a short, clear note.
- **Reflect** on what I've learned over time.

Each entry will be a small Markdown file named by date and topic.
